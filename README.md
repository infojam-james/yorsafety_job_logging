Yorsafety Job Logging solution
=

>There is currently no way to log health and safety jobs and advice given for day to day queries. A job logging system would also allow the task to be allocated and responses archived. Outstanding actions would sit on the appropriate dashboards.

**Requirements in a new Job Logging solution**
-
+ Tasks to be allocated to system users by those with appropriate permissions
 
+ Archive & view responses

+ Allocated actions awaiting completion to be viewed via dashboards of the appropriate users.

**Key features of existing Health & Safety Task Management solutions**
-
+ Clear distinction between Tasks and Actions - one task may generate several actions (e.g. 'Check item annually' is a *Task*,  annual occurrences of said check are the *Actions*)
 
+ Tasks/actions assigned on a role - not individual - basis, to allow for continuity through personnel/responsibility changes.

+ Delegating responsibility for task

+ Audit trail for each task
